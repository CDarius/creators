# creators
Central place to register `systemonachip` creator ids. These are used to identify unique gateware at all levels such as systems, peripherals or busses. They are 32-bit unique numbers that are paired with 32-bit creation ids that are administered by the particular user. These are similar to USB VID and PID but open source and freely available. They are useful to confirm that a driver is talking to a known system.
