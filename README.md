# Creation IDs
Creation IDs are used to digitally identify unique creations of many forms. They are a unique 32-bit creator id that is paired with 32-bit creation ids that are administered by the particular user. These are similar to USB VID and PID but open source and freely available. They can be used in any system that needs a standard creation identifier such as BLE device discovery or FPGA peripheral identification.
